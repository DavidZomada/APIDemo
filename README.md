# APIDemo

## About the repository
I proposed to challenge myself to create a completely functional app that works globally using:
- **Xamarin.Forms** to develop the Android and iOS app
- **ASP.NET** to deploy an APIRest CRUD service
- **SQL Server** to create the database
- **Azure** to allocated the database and the server

For this project, I'm gonna create an herbarium, that reveals the mysteries of the plants to better understand their benefits and how they could help us in our daily routine. On this app, we will be able to search, filter, from the database, and add or delete our favorite plants.
