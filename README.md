# APIDemo

## About the repository
My proposal was to challenge myself to create a completely functional app that works globally using:
- **Xamarin.Forms** to develop the Android and iOS app
- **ASP.NET** to deploy an APIRest CRUD service
- **SQL Server** to create the database
- **Azure** to allocated the database and the server

For this project I'm gonna create a ****** app where the user could reach, filter, add or delete him/her favorite plants.

### Goals
My goals are:
- ⭐️    Use the best practices to make it look like it was made by a senior taking
